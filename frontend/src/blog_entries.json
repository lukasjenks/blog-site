DOTS is supposed to make it much easier to allow games to make use of multicore processors and multithreading in general, while their \"Burst Compiler\" utilizes JIT compilation to allow C# Unity code to run essentially as fast or faster than if it were written in C++ (just what I've heard). I have to say I'm skeptical about that last part but am eager to dive back into Unity at least for a while to see if this is true. I was looking for an excuse to lately anyways.",

While its not stylized quite how I'd like, it'll work for now. I can always refresh it later - I had been meaning to try out semantic UI as opposed to bootstrap and material UI anyways, so that would provide for a good excuse to do so."
